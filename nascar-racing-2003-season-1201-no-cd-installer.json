Goes through a fresh install, patching the game to 1.2.0.1, and copying the No-CD crack.","notes":"This installation procedure should get the game working with no issue. One thing to note is that in the graphics config after installation, each monitor will appear as it's own GPU. You will have to experiment with which one corresponds to a particular monitor. Disabling full screen also locks the game to 60 FPS. I haven't figured out a way around this.","credits":"","created_at":"2022-07-31T20:04:00.793990Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T20:04:00.794011Z","draft":true,"published":false,"published_by":null,"rating":"","is_playable":null,"steamid":null,"gogid":null,"gogslug":"","humbleid":"","humblestoreid":"","humblestoreid_real":"","script":{"files":[{"cd_installer":"N/A:Select Setup.exe from the game's CD files."},{"update_installer":"N/A:Select 1.2.0.1 update exe."},{"no_cd_file":"N/A:Select the 1.2.0.1 No-CD file."}],"game":{"arch":"win32","exe":"$GAMEDIR/drive_c/Papyrus/NASCAR Racing 2003 Season/NR2003.exe","prefix":"$GAMEDIR","working_dir":"$GAMEDIR/drive_c/Papyrus/NASCAR Racing 2003 Season"},"installer":[{"task":{"executable":"cd_installer","name":"wineexec","prefix":"$GAMEDIR/prefix"}},{"task":{"executable":"update_installer","name":"wineexec","prefix":"$GAMEDIR/prefix"}},{"move":{"dst":"working_dir/NR2003_CD.exe","src":"working_dir/NR2003.exe"}},{"move":{"dst":"working_dir/NR2003.exe","src":"no_cd_file"}}],"system":[{"env":{"SOMEENV":true}}]},"content":"files:\n- cd_installer: N/A:Select Setup.exe from the game's CD files.\n- update_installer: N/A:Select 1.2.0.1 update exe.\n- no_cd_file: N/A:Select the 1.2.0.1 No-CD file.\ngame:\n  arch: win32\n  exe: $GAMEDIR/drive_c/Papyrus/NASCAR Racing 2003 Season/NR2003.exe\n  prefix: $GAMEDIR\n  working_dir: $GAMEDIR/drive_c/Papyrus/NASCAR Racing 2003 Season\ninstaller:\n- task:\n    executable: cd_installer\n    name: wineexec\n    prefix: $GAMEDIR/prefix\n- task:\n    executable: update_installer\n    name: wineexec\n    prefix: $GAMEDIR/prefix\n- move:\n    dst: working_dir/NR2003_CD.exe\n    src: working_dir/NR2003.exe\n- move:\n    dst: working_dir/NR2003.exe\n    src: no_cd_file\nsystem:\n- env:\n    SOMEENV: true\n"}]}
